    "# Vectorization, Numpy Universal Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to write performant code using numerical libraries, it is useful to keep the following rule in mind:\n",
    "> Code that is predictable can be made fast\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common example of predictable code is a fixed length loop which performs the same operation at each iteration (up to changes in index)\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "1. Matrix-vector multiplication\n",
    "2. Functions applied element-wise to an array\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-examples:\n",
    "1. Code with branch instructions (`if`, `else`, etc.)\n",
    "2. Code with recursive function calls (at least in Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason why predictable code can be fast is that most CPUs have what is called a [branch predictor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor) in them, which pre-loads computation.  If a branch is predicted incorrectly, then the CPU has to switch gears and go along the correct brach, which takes time.  Code without branches will minimize the number of branch prediction errors, speeding up code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason why predictable code can be made fast is vectorization.  If you are performing the same operation in a predictable way, code can employ special instructions such as [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) which can greatly increase efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to worry about the details in Python, but it is good to know how to write code that allows libraries like NumPy to take advantage of these techniques.  Note that standard Python loops will not take advantage of these things - you typically need to use libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Universal Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy universal functions (or ufuncs) are functions that are applied element-wise to an array.  Examples include most math operations and logical comparisons.  You can find additional information in [the ufunc documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/ufuncs.html).\n",

    "## Numba\n",
    "\n",
    "[Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) is a just in time (JIT) compiler for Python code.  It provides several decorators which make it very easy to get speedups for numerical code in many situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just in time compilation is an increasingly popular solution that bridges the gap between interpreted and compiled languages.  Generally:\n",
    "* Interpreted languages (such as Python) simply read code line-by-line and execute as they go along.\n",
    "* Compiled languages (such as C, C++, fortran) compile code into a binary, which can be optimized to run quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "Compilation takes time intially but saves time when you use the binary.  Python libraries such as NumPy and SciPy use compiled libraries under the hood for speed.  Interpreted languages tend to be slower, but are easier to develop in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just in time compilation will produce a compiled version of a function the first time it is needed.  [Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a relatively new language which uses JIT to produce fast code with less development overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things you need to know to compile code is the types used - if you want to use different types (e.g. single *and* double precision versions of a function), you need different compiled versions.  Python usually allows you to not worry too much about type, but this is one reason why you need to know about it anyways in scientific computing.\n",
